# Pull Request Review Instructions

Rules for new entries in each category table.

These types of promotions/discounts/deals will **NOT** be accepted. These rules are designed to maximize satisfaction for people who browse the deal list and use the deals to buy the listed products.

🚫 100% OFF deals, "Free while in beta" deals
🚫 "Anti-sale"/"price increase soon" deals
🚫 Pre-order deals
🚫 Deals contain shortened links
🚫 Deals with links to other deals/bundles/listings
🚫 Deals that ask people to like/comment/subscribe/contact us/do something to get the discount code
🚫 Deals that are not specific for Black Friday.
🚫 Deals that are unclear whether it is a real deal or fake deal, for example, no indication on the product page to show specific Black Friday discount, timeline, specific discount amount/percentage, specific discount code, etc.

Other rules:
🚫 If you have more than 2 deals/courses/apps that are closely related to each other, please submit them as only 1 entry, not multiple ones (i.e., don't spam the links in all the categories).
🚫 Please don't create new categories by yourself, put your deal in the MISC section and we'll categorize them later
🚫 Please clean up your PR so that it only contains relevant diff (to add or update your discount). If the PR has too many unrelated diff it won't be merged.
